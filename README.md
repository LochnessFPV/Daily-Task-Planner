## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

  WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

  WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

  WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

  WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

  WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

  WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
